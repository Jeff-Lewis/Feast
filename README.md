# Feast
Looking for a feed? Have a Feast.

## Setup

1. Install the plugin.
2. In the admin screen, head over to the Feeds page and add a new feed or two.
3. Activate a Feast-capable theme. [Razor](https://github.com/rmccue/Feast-Razor)
   is the recommended theme for most users.

## About
Feast is a feed reader plugin for WordPress. It's designed to be paired with a
Feast-capable theme which can display feeds and items in a feed reader
interface. Existing themes may work, but it's unlikely that they will display
items in an optimised manner.

## Future Plans
Feast is currently in development mode, so things may break as development moves
fast. Any and all feedback is appreciated.

In the future, Feast will be a paid plugin, however you're welcome to use it for
free. Note that support won't be offered past bug reports.
